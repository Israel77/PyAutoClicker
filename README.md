A very simple Python auto clicker. 
Uses PyMouse to simulate mouse clicks and Tkinter for a GUI.

Very useful for a number of online games.

==== Installation ====

The only dependencies are on [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) and Tkinter. For Ubuntu, this is as simple as 

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-xlib python-tk  
    sudo pip install PyUserInput

Then you should be all set. You just run autoClickGUI.py to use the program.
If you are averse to GUIs, there is a much more minimal command line version
if you run autoClick.py.

The only supported platform at the moment is Linux and Python 2.7.
This could be expanded in the future :)
