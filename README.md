A very simple Python auto clicker. Uses PyMouse to simulate mouse clicks.

Very useful for a number of online games.

==== Installation ====

The only dependency is on [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput). For Linux, this is as simple as 

    sudo apt-get install python-pip  
    sudo apt-get install python-xlib  
    sudo pip install PyUserInput

Then you should be all set. Installing on Windows would be harder, take a look
at the link above for what you'd need. Mac is currently not supported.
